# FitFlow Redesign

## Project Overview

FitFlow is a fitness tracking application redesign based on a human-centered design case study. The redesign addresses the following key problems and introduces features to solve them:
- **Personalization gap**: Addressed through AI-powered personalized workout plans.
- **Social isolation**: Addressed through social community features.
- **High friction in daily tracking**: Reduced through streamlined tracking features.
- **Lack of motivation/celebratory elements**: Addressed through engaging progress dashboards and social features.
- **Improved nutrition tracking**: Making use of computer vision for nutrition photo recognition.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of the redesign is to create a more engaging, personalized, and socially connected fitness tracking experience that reduces user friction and increases long-term motivation.

## Selected Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | React Native | Cross-platform mobile application (iOS/Android) |
| Web | React Native Web | Web compatibility using the same codebase |
| Backend | Node.js + Express.js | Core API and backend services |
| Database | Firebase Firestore + Realtime Database | Primary NoSQL datastore and real-time social features |
| Authentication | Firebase Authentication | Secure user identity and sign-in management |
| AI/ML | TensorFlow Lite + Cloud ML | On-device personalization and heavier recommendation models |
| Computer Vision | ML Kit / accessible computer-vision service | Nutrition photo recognition |
| Cache | Redis | Server-side caching for performance |
| Storage | Firebase Cloud Storage | Storing user media and application assets |
| Analytics | Firebase Analytics & Crash reporting | User behavior tracking and application stability monitoring |
| Client-side offline cache | SQLite | Offline data support |

*Note: PostgreSQL/Supabase may be used optionally as a secondary database for relational reporting needs.*

## Architecture Overview

The system utilizes a modern, decoupled architecture with a React Native client communicating through an Express API Gateway to backend microservices, including specialized AI and Computer Vision components.
